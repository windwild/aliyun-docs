The audio clip begins with a sudden, loud, metallic clanking that dominates the soundstage, immediately indicating an industrial or workshop environment. The clanking is rhythmic, consistent, and has a sharp, resonant quality, suggestive of metal tools striking metal surfaces—likely a hammer, wrench, or similar instrument being used on a hard metal object. The sound is harsh and slightly distorted, with audible clipping on each impact, likely due to the microphone’s proximity and the high volume of the sound.
As the initial clanking fades, a male voice enters, speaking in Mandarin Chinese with a tone of exasperation and complaint. His voice is clear, close-mic’d, and free from distortion. He says: “哎呀，这样我还怎么安静工作啊？” (“Oh my, how can I possibly work quietly like this?”). His intonation is conversational, informal, and marked by a rising, questioning inflection, typical of everyday speech rather than performance or formal address. The accent is standard Putonghua, with no strong regional markers, suggesting he is a native Mandarin speaker from the northern or central regions of China.
During the speaker’s utterance, the metallic clanking resumes, overlapping with his voice. The timing and nature of these sounds indicate the speaker is directly reacting to the ongoing noise—likely caused by another person in the same space. The environment is acoustically “dry” with minimal echo, implying a small or medium-sized room with sound-absorbing materials, further supporting the workshop or industrial setting. There are no other background noises, music, or ambient sounds, and no evidence of a public or commercial space.
The recording quality is moderate: the microphone captures both the low-end thuds and the sharp metallic transients, but the loud clanking causes digital clipping, resulting in a harsh, “crunchy” distortion during the impacts. The speaker’s voice, however, remains clear and intelligible. The overall impression is of a candid, real-world interaction—possibly a worker or office employee complaining about an interruption in a noisy environment.
In summary, the audio depicts a Mandarin-speaking man in a workshop or industrial setting, reacting with frustration to ongoing metallic clanking that disrupts his work. The recording is informal, clear, and grounded in a context of manual labor or technical work, with no evidence of scripted performance, music, or extraneous activity.

        "content": "The audio clip is a brief, low-fidelity recording-approximately six seconds long—captured in a small, reverberant indoor space, likely a home office or bedroom. It opens with a rapid, metallic, rhythmic hammering sound, repeating every 0.5 to 0.6 seconds, with each strike slightly uneven and accompanied by a short echo. This sound dominates the left side of the stereo field and is close to the microphone, suggesting the hammering is occurring nearby and slightly to the left.\n\nOverlaid with the hammering, a single male voice speaks in Mandarin Chinese, his tone clearly one of frustration and exasperation. He says, “哎呀，这样我还怎么安静工作啊？” (“Oh, with this, how am I supposed to work quietly?”) His speech is clear despite the poor audio quality, and is delivered in a standard, unaccented Mandarin, indicative of a native speaker from northern or central China.\n\nThe voice is more distant and centered in the stereo field, with more room reverberation than the hammering. The emotional content is palpable: his voice rises slightly at the end, turning the phrase into a rhetorical complaint, underscoring his irritation. No other voices, music, or ambient sounds are present; the only non-speech sounds are the hammering and the faint hiss of the recording device.\n\nThe combination of the environmental sound, the speaker’s language, and his tone strongly suggests a scenario of home office disruption—perhaps someone working from home is being disturbed by renovation or repair work happening nearby. The recording ends abruptly, mid-hammer, further emphasizing the spontaneous and candid nature of the capture.\n\nIn summary, the audio is a realistic, low-fidelity snapshot of a Mandarin-speaking man, likely in China, expressing frustration at being unable to work in peace due to nearby construction or repair activity, captured in a personal, indoor setting.",\

The primary sound is a male speaker, likely in his late teens to mid-20s, speaking Mandarin Chinese in a tone of mild exasperation. His speech is clear and natural, delivered in a conversational manner: “哎呀，这样我还怎么安静工作啊？” (“Oh, how can I possibly work quietly like this?”). His voice is close to the microphone, and the room is acoustically neutral, with no noticeable echo or background noise, suggesting a small, well-furnished space.\n\nOverlaying the speech is a persistent, rhythmic mechanical sound—a series of sharp, metallic clicks or clatters that repeat every 0.6 seconds. The sound is dry and lacks any reverberation, further supporting the inference that it is produced by a mechanical device very close to the microphone. The regularity and timbre of the sound suggest a small, metallic object (such as a key, coin, or pen) being repeatedly tapped or struck on a hard surface, rather than a larger or more complex machine.\n\nThe speaker’s complaint is a direct response to the mechanical noise, expressing frustration at being unable to concentrate or work in peace due to the disturbance. The tone is not angry or urgent, but rather one of resigned annoyance, typical of someone encountering a minor, persistent annoyance in a personal or domestic setting.\n\nThere are no other voices, music, or environmental cues present. The overall impression is of a brief, candid moment—perhaps a student, office worker, or someone in a quiet home environment—caught on microphone while complaining (to themselves or a nearby companion) about a distracting, repetitive noise. The recording is technically clean and focused, with all attention on the speaker and the mechanical sound, making it highly plausible that the clip was captured intentionally, possibly for a voice note, social media post, or as a sample for a sound effect library."\

## 工作方式

- **单轮交互：** 模型不支持多轮对话。每次请求都是一次独立的分析任务。

- **固定任务**：模型的核心任务是生成音频描述（仅为英文描述），无法通过指令（如 System Message）改变其行为，例如控制输出格式或内容重点。

- **仅支持音频输入：** 模型仅接收音频作为输入，无需传入文本提示，`message`参数格式固定。



**message 格式示例**

## **流式输出**

大模型接收到输入后，会逐步生成中间结果，最终结果由这些中间结果拼接而成。这种一边生成一边输出中间结果的方式称为流式输出。采用流式输出时，您可以在模型进行输出的同时阅读，减少等待模型回复的时间。

通过 OpenAI 兼容方式开启流式输出十分方便，只需在请求参数中设置`stream`参数为`true`即可。

可通过DashScope SDK或HTTP方式调用千问VL模型，体验流式输出的功能。根据不同的调用方式需设置相应的参数来实现流式输出：

- Python SDK方式：设置`stream`参数为True。

- Java SDK方式：需要通过`streamCall`接口调用。

- HTTP方式：需要在Header中指定`X-DashScope-SSE`为`enable`。


> 流式输出的内容默认是非增量式（即每次返回的内容都包含之前生成的内容），如果您需要使用增量式流式输出，请设置`incremental_output`（Java 为`incrementalOutput`）参数为 `true` 。

## **传入本地文件（Base64 编码或文件路径）**

模型提供两种本地文件上传方式：

- Base64 编码上传

- 文件路径直接上传（ **传输更稳定，推荐方式**）


**上传方式：**

文件路径传入

Base64 编码传入

直接向模型传入文件路径。仅 DashScope Python 和 Java SDK 支持，不支持 HTTP 方式。请您参考下表，结合您的编程语言与操作系统指定文件的路径。

**指定文件的路径**

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **系统** | **SDK** | **传入的文件路径** | **示例** |
| Linux或macOS系统 | Python SDK | file://{文件的绝对路径} | file:///home/images/test.mp3 |
| Java SDK |
| Windows系统 | Python SDK | file://{文件的绝对路径} | file://D:/images/test.mp3 |
| Java SDK | file:///{文件的绝对路径} | file:///D:/images/test.mp3 |

Base64 编码，将文件转换为 Base64 编码字符串，再传入模型。

**传入 Base64 编码字符串的步骤**

1. 文件编码：将本地音频文件转换为 Base64 编码；



**音频转换为 Base64 编码的示例代码**




















```python
import base64

# 编码函数：将本地文件转换为 Base64 编码的字符串
def encode_audio(audio_path):
       with open(audio_path, "rb") as audio_file:
           return base64.b64encode(audio_file.read()).decode("utf-8")

# 将xxxx/test.mp3替换为你本地音频的绝对路径
base64_audio = encode_audio("xxxx/test.mp3")
```

2. 构建 [Data URL](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2397)，格式如下：`data:;base64,{base64_audio}`，`base64_audio`为上一步生成的 Base64 字符串；

3. 调用模型：通过`audio`（DashScope SDK）或`input_audio`（OpenAI 兼容 SDK）参数传递`Data URL`并调用模型。


**使用限制：**

- **建议优先选择文件路径上传（传输更稳定）**，1MB以下的文件也可使用 Base64 编码；

- 直接传入文件路径时，音频本身需小于 10MB；

- Base64编码方式传入时，由于 Base64 编码会增加数据体积，需保证编码后的 Base64 字符串需小于 10MB。


文件路径传入

Base64 编码传入

> 传入文件路径仅支持 DashScope Python 和 Java SDK方式调用，不支持 HTTP 方式。

## 常见问题

### **如何压缩音频文件到满足要求的大小？**

- 在线工具：使用 [Compresss](https://www.compresss.com/cn/compress-audio.html) 等在线工具压缩音频文件。

- 代码实现：使用FFmpeg工具，更多用法请参见 [FFmpeg官网](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)。















```bash
# 基础转换命令（万能模板）
# -i，作用：输入文件路径，常用值示例：input.mp3

# -b:a，作用： 设置音频比特率 ，
    # 一般取值有64kbps(低质量，适合语音、低带宽流媒体)、128k（中等质量，适合日常音频、播客）、192kbps（高质量，适合音乐、广播）
    # 比特率越高，音质越好，文件体积越大

# -ar，作用：设置音频采样率，表示每秒采样的次数，
# 一般取值为8000Hz、22050Hz、44100 Hz(标准采样率)
# 采样率越高，文件体积越大

# -ac，作用：设置音频通道数。一般取值有 1（单声道），2（立体声），单声道文件体积更小

# -y，作用：覆盖已存在文件(无需值)# output.mp3，作用：输出文件路径

ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -b:a 128k -ar 44100 -ac 1 output.mp3 -y
```


## **限制**

模型对音频文件的限制如下：

- **时长限制：** 时长需小于或等于 40 分钟

- **文件数量：** 每次请求仅支持1个音频文件

- **文件格式**：支持AMR、 WAV（CodecID: GSM\_MS）、 WAV（PCM）、 3GP、 3GPP、 AAC、 MP3等主流格式

- **文件输入方式：**公网可访问的音频URL、 Base64 编码、本地文件路径

- **文件大小：**


  - 公网URL传入：不超过 1GB

  - 传入文件路径：音频本身需小于 10MB

  - Base64编码传入：需确保编码后 Base64 字符串小于 10MB，详情请参见 [如何传入本地文件](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/qwen3-omni-captioner#d3c86b47f8ora "")
